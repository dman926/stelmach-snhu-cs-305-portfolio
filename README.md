- Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  - Artemis Financial, a consulting company specializing in individualized financial plans, sought to modernize their operations. They required assistance in enhancing the security of their web application, which handles sensitive financial data, including savings, retirement plans, investments, and insurance information. The challenge was to ensure secure communications, address international transaction complexities, comply with varying security regulations, and safeguard against external threats, such as data breaches and unauthorized access.
- What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  - During the vulnerability assessment, identifying the critical areas of security was crucial. Understanding the significance of secure communications, compliance with regulations, and protecting against external threats, I focused on key aspects: authentication and authorization, data encryption, input validation, session management, and secure coding practices. By implementing these measures, the confidentiality and integrity of Artemis Financial's data were preserved.
  - Coding securely is paramount because it prevents potential disasters like data breaches or unauthorized access. Secure coding practices add substantial value to a company's overall wellbeing by mitigating known vulnerabilities, ensuring compliance with industry standards, building customer trust, and preventing data breaches that could lead to financial loss and reputational damage.
- What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  - The challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was ensuring compliance with international security standards and addressing the implications of varying security regulations across countries. This required a comprehensive understanding of global security standards, enabling Artemis Financial to operate seamlessly in diverse jurisdictions.
- How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  - To enhance security, I focused on updating vulnerable libraries and frameworks, ensuring secure algorithm usage, implementing input validation, and error handling. Additionally, I emphasized secure communication, authentication, authorization, regular updates, logging, and monitoring.
  - In the future, I would use a combination of tools like OWASP Dependency-Check for dependency scanning, static code analysis tools for early vulnerability detection, and regular code reviews. These methods help in identifying vulnerabilities and deciding on appropriate mitigation techniques to ensure robust security.
- How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  - To ensure functionality and security, I employed rigorous testing methodologies. After refactoring the code, extensive testing was performed, including unit tests, integration tests, and security testing. Automated testing tools were utilized to identify any new vulnerabilities introduced during the refactoring process. A combination of manual code review and automated tools ensured that the code and software application were both functional and secure.
- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  - In this project, I utilized OWASP Dependency-Check for vulnerability scanning, static code analysis tools for early vulnerability detection, and modular coding practices. These resources and tools, along with the emphasis on secure coding practices, can serve as valuable assets in future assignments or tasks, ensuring the development of secure and robust software applications.
- Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  - From this assignment, I can showcase the comprehensive vulnerability assessment report and the detailed mitigation plan I developed for Artemis Financial. This demonstrates my expertise in identifying critical security areas, implementing secure coding practices, and ensuring compliance with industry standards. Additionally, I can present the use of tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and static code analysis to highlight my commitment to creating secure software applications. These artifacts provide tangible evidence of my skills, knowledge, and experience in the field of software security.
